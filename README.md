This repository contains all my projects, exercises, and experiences during one of the most intense and rewarding coding bootcamps out there.

## 📌 About the Piscine

The *Piscine* ("swimming pool" in French) is a 4-week selection process where candidates dive deep into the world of programming using C. It’s all about peer-to-peer learning, self-discipline, and perseverance. No teachers, no classes — just code, teamwork, and a lot of problem-solving.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

This repo includes:
- Daily exercises and personal projects
- Evaluations and peer reviews
- Rushes and group challenges
- My progress, struggles, and breakthroughs

## 🚀 Highlights

- Mastered the basics of C programming
- Learned to work in a pressure-filled, collaborative environment
- Developed problem-solving skills through logic-heavy challenges

## 🌊 My Experience

The Piscine was tough, exciting, and unforgettable. It pushed me far beyond my comfort zone and helped me grow not only as a coder but also as a learner and teammate. This repo is a personal archive of that wild ride.
